# AWS Private CA Issuer

This repository was donated to the cert-manager organisation and can now be found at [cert-manager/aws-privateca-issuer](https://github.com/cert-manager/aws-privateca-issuer).

The helm repository and docker images will still work but won't receive any updates. So please refer to the Readme to update those as soon as possible.
